This is a test project of a specific javascript stack

The goal is to test the following stack altogether :

- React : Front rendering
- NextJS : Server rendered app
- Apollo (both client and server) : Communication between client/server for graphql
- Prisma : Dealing with graphql server hosting
- Graphql : Query language
- Enzyme : Unit testing for react components
- Jest : Server side unit testing

The goal is to host this stack on AWS instances with a load balancer and dockerized apps.
Continuous integration to be implemented with service such as travis-ci.
